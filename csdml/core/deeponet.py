# 1. DeepONet for better performance based on problem structure
# 2. Gradient-enhanced training to reduce the number of samples needed
# 3. Bayesian inference to intellegently sample the design space

    This function generates a feedforward neural network in CSDL with the specified layers and activation function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    layers : list
        A list of integers representing the number of neurons in each layer.
    activation : str, optional
        The activation function to use. Default is 'tanh'.
